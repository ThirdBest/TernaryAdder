# TernaryAdder

There are 10 kinds of people: those who understand ternary, those who don't, and those who are uncertain.

Q & A for those wishing to learn about the scope of this project:

Q: Why are you doing this?
A: The reason for this experiment is to determine whether or not a ternary adder can surpass a binary adder in terms of speed.

Q: How are you going to test this?
A: Emulating both a binary and ternary adder, and testing the speed of each under different constraints using a set of pseudorandomly generated decimal integers. The emulator will be responsible for generating and converting the numbers.

Q: Different Constraints? Elaborate.
A: The constraints will be a constant and a variable. The constant is the amount of instructions generated by the emulator, and the variable is the digit count of each number.

Q: What about lookahead or other control functions?
A: Lookahead in the emulator is seperate from the class of the ternary adder itself. It is a data structure that functions for both the binary and ternary adders. As for other control circuits: the scope of this project does not extend into that area.

Q: What language and source control are you using to build the emulator?
A: C++ with Visual Studio.
